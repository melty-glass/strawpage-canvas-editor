I'll try to make it more understandable later, but the main thing you need to know is that I define two functions in this script: `resize()` and `ref()`.

The format for resizing the canvas is `resize(width, height)`.

To import a reference image onto the canvas, use `ref(image URL, x value to draw at, y value to draw at, image width, image height)`. The last four are optional. You can change the image width and height to stretch or squish images.

This image won't show up in the strawpage owner's gimmicks tab. (I'm working on making it sendable so I can send people random memes...!)
